# TGTG Scanner

Scanns your favorite TGTG Magic Bags for new available items and notifies you via mail, IFTTT or pushSafer. Notifications will be send when the available amount of magic bags rises from zero to something.

## Disclaimer

TGTG forbids the use of their plattform the way this tool does. In their Terms and Conditions it says: "The Consumer must not misuse the Platform (including hacking or 'scraping')."

If you use this tool you do it at your own risk. TGTG may stop you from doing so and may even delete your account.

I would recommend to create a new account for the scanner.

The software is provided as is without warranty of any kind. If you have problems, find bugs or have suggestions for improvement feel free to create an issue or contribute to the project.

## Installation

You can install this tool on any computer. For 24/7 notifications I recommended to install the tool on a NAS like Synology or a Raspberry Pi. You can also use a virtual cloud server. Starting at 1,00 â‚¬/Month at Strato.de or try AWS free tier.

If you have any problems or questions feel free to create an issue.

You have the following three options to install the scanner, ascending in complexity:

### Use prebuild Release

This is the simplest but least flexible solution suitable for most operating systems.

1. Download latest Release from https://github.com/Der-Henning/tgtg/releases for your OS
2. Unzip Archiv
3. Edit ```config.ini``` as described in the file
4. Run scanner

You can run the scanner manually if you need it, add it to your autostart or create a service.

### Run with Docker

My prefered method for servers with a pre build multi-arch linux image.

1. Install Docker and docker-compose
2. Edit ```docker-compose.yml``` as described in the file
3. Run ```docker-compose up -d```

### Run from source

Method for pros and developers.

1. Install python and pip
2. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Create ```src/config.ini``` as described in the file ```config.template.ini```
4. Run ```python src/scanner.py```

### Running

When the scanner is started it will send a test notification on all configured notifiers. If you don't reveive any notifications, please check your configuration.

## Developing

For developement I recommend using docker. The Makefile depends on docker and docker-compose.

```make start-dev``` builds and starts the developement docker image

```make image``` builds docker image

```make bash``` starts python docker image with mounted project

```make builder``` runs pyinstaller in python docker image

### Building executables

The executables are build with pyinstaller.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```pip install pyinstaller```

```pyinstaller scanner.spec```

### Creating notifiers

Feel free to create and contribute new notifiers for other services and endpoints.
